Hello, World. Here is my
<a href="/media/resume.pdf" target="_blank"> Amazing Resume!</a><br>
<br>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>
  Here is an example projects I created: <br>
  As per my assignment, I found an application I use regularly that I had a pain point with: Humanity. Within the app,
  I found it difficult to intuitively know where the "unpaid leave" or "time off" was. <br>
  For example, I needed to have a doctors appointment, so how do I schedule time off from work for that? <br>
</p>
<p> 
  I created a write-up of an example of the intutive area to look for this problem, navigating to the shifts menu, 
  looking at "CAN'T WORK" section, and not finding it. <br>
  Then, I added a "Time Off" button, indicating what I as a user was actually looking for.
</p>

<br>
<p>
  At this point, I then went into figma and designed 
  <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/5yTw5Q9hZpI8gQbOnWi4Lw/FigmaReplication" target="_blank"> a mock-up of the goal with my design</a>
  -- the extent of which was simply an additional button. Recreating the menu was a good oppurtunity as well to 
  understand some of the basics of the original design; the goal was to be simplistic and use as few words as 
  possible to get the goal across with the buttons: I copied that to the best of my abilities.
