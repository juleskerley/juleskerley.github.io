Hello, World. Here is my
<a href="/media/resume.pdf" target="_blank"> Amazing Resume!</a><br>
<br>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Project 1</h3>
<p>
  Here is an example projects I created: <br>
  As per my assignment, I found an application I use regularly that I had a pain point with: Humanity. Within the app,
  I found it difficult to intuitively know where the "unpaid leave" or "time off" was. <br>
  For example, I needed to have a doctors appointment, so how do I schedule time off from work for that? <br>
</p>
<p> 
  I created a write-up of an example of the intutive area to look for this problem, navigating to the shifts menu, 
  looking at "CAN'T WORK" section, and not finding it. <br>
  Then, I added a "Time Off" button, indicating what I as a user was actually looking for.

<br>
<p>
  At this point, I then went into figma and designed 
  <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/5yTw5Q9hZpI8gQbOnWi4Lw/FigmaReplication" target="_blank"> a mock-up of the goal with my design</a>
  -- the extent of which was simply an additional button. Recreating the menu was a good oppurtunity as well to 
  understand some of the basics of the original design; the goal was to be simplistic and use as few words as 
  possible to get the goal across with the buttons: I copied that to the best of my abilities.

<h3>Project 2</h3>
<p>
  The next project I worked on was a challenge type project; I was given a prompt and created a 
  solution within the specifications of the design. The challenges were sourced from
  <a href="https://uxplanet.org/https-medium-com-sadslasania-15-days-of-the-daily-ux-writing-challenge-121c08ec8aec" target="_blank"> a website with 15 challenges</a>
  . The website also included the original author's method of solving said challenge for inspiration.
  I chose challenge 10:

  For
  <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/8KYvKalbIuafe0u9GEdCVa/WritingAssign2-Prob10?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank"> my solution made in Figma</a>
  I decided primarily to keep the content simple. Today, most website's I've seen include text that 
  states that they do not sell your information if they are trying to gain trust. Especially when the 
  amount of data is as small as what is requested (Zip and First name), I would feel comfortable giving
  that. <br>
  I would imagine that most users are able to infer that, when getting rental cars in their area,
  a zip code is one of the less intrusive requests. First name is also hardly any information. Although
  the gray text is not a "legally binding" promise, it does reassure me when I see it. <br>
