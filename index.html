Hello, World. Here is my
<a href="/media/resume.pdf" target="_blank"> Amazing Resume!</a><br>
<br>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Project 1</h3>
<p>
  Here is an example projects I created: <br>
  As per my assignment, I found an application I use regularly that I had a pain point with: Humanity. Within the app,
  I found it difficult to intuitively know where the "unpaid leave" or "time off" was. <br>
  For example, I needed to have a doctors appointment, so how do I schedule time off from work for that? <br>
</p>
<p> 
  I created a write-up of an example of the intutive area to look for this problem, navigating to the shifts menu, 
  looking at "CAN'T WORK" section, and not finding it. <br>
  Then, I added a "Time Off" button, indicating what I as a user was actually looking for.
</p>

<br>
<p>
  At this point, I then went into figma and designed 
  <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/5yTw5Q9hZpI8gQbOnWi4Lw/FigmaReplication" target="_blank"> a mock-up of the goal with my design</a>
  -- the extent of which was simply an additional button. Recreating the menu was a good oppurtunity as well to 
  understand some of the basics of the original design; the goal was to be simplistic and use as few words as 
  possible to get the goal across with the buttons: I copied that to the best of my abilities.

<h3>Project 2</h3>
<p>
  The next project I worked on was a challenge type project; I was given a prompt and created a 
  solution within the specifications of the design. The challenges were sourced from
  <a href="https://uxplanet.org/https-medium-com-sadslasania-15-days-of-the-daily-ux-writing-challenge-121c08ec8aec" target="_blank"> a website with 15 challenges</a>
  . The website also included the original author's method of solving said challenge for inspiration.
  I chose challenge 10:

  For
  <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/8KYvKalbIuafe0u9GEdCVa/WritingAssign2-Prob10?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank"> my solution made in Figma</a>
  I decided primarily to keep the content simple. Today, most website's I've seen include text that 
  states that they do not sell your information if they are trying to gain trust. Especially when the 
  amount of data is as small as what is requested (Zip and First name), I would feel comfortable giving
  that. <br>
  I would imagine that most users are able to infer that, when getting rental cars in their area,
  a zip code is one of the less intrusive requests. First name is also hardly any information. Although
  the gray text is not a "legally binding" promise, it does reassure me when I see it. <br>

<h3>Project 3</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/DwBpwLWw7OJCxeaaH60KVT/PC-2-Team-Project?node-id=0%3A1&t=nMnRYsx0jUQKOw5m-1" target="_blank">The final figma project</a>
  was another redesign of an existing creation,
  <a href="https://www.usbank.com/index.html" target="_blank">the US Bank website</a>
  . However, this one was in tandem with my peers, meaning that while redesigning, we had to maintinan a sense
  of creative cohesion. With that we shared several assets and decisions along the way to make the production
  of this project easier and result in a better redesign.
  <br>
  My focus was redesigning the
  <a href="https://www.usbank.com/customer-service/personal-banking/mobile-and-online-banking.html" target="_blank">US Bank Mobile App Customer Support section</a>
  , and the original had some key problems:
  <ul>
    <li>
      All help regarding multiple subject was on the page at once. This was disorganized and a lackluster implementation
      that forced users to have to sift through all help to find specifically what they need.
    </li>
    <li>
      The help was in drop down menus, leading to two consequences: While it helped mitigate the fact that all material
      was on the same page, it did not help people who may attempt to use a common keyboard shortcut such as Control+F
      to find the actual content they need; in addition, it could result in an accessiblity issue regarding screen readers.
    </li>
    <li>
      There was no overview of what was on the page nor a table of contents, making the reader responsible for having
      to find out what is on the page themselves.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>

</p>
<p>
  <a href="/media/Blog-How-To_Files/Blog How-To.pdf" target="_blank"> My US Banks Mobile App Customer Support redesign</a>
  is a considerable overhaul. I aimed to accomplish several keys goals:
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Add an overview for readers to identify if they are in the correct place and a Table of Contents that can jump a reader
      to the content they are most interested in.
    </li>
    <li>
      Expand the text and the support into an introductory guide rather than miscellaneous problems. This allows entirely new
      users to gain a firm foundation of the app and its abilities. This would help with keeping features from being underutilized
      as well.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make the text immediately readable without any complications. This benefits both viewers who are quickly attempting to find their content,
      less experienced users who may hesitate investigate the drop downs, and screen readers that attempt to read the text on the screen.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/media/Blog-How-To_Files/Header.png" alt="A view of the header, consistent across the front page designs; includes a new breadcrumbs design that implies a more broken up customer support area"> <br>
</p>
<p>
  The header was slightly redesigned, most of it being copied over. I worked to recreate the header buttons and search bar in Figma, but you will
  likely notice it is not too different from the original. The primary change made is in the "Breadcrumbs" part. <br>
  I am implying that the Guides, Troubleshooting, and more are more broken up on a previous page, this page being just one of many various guides
  or other types of informative blogs on the website. This organizes the work far better than putting all potential problems across all subjects regarding
  mobile banking on a single page.
</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/media/Blog-How-To_Files/Introduction.png" alt="A view of the Introduction including an overview and a table of contents"> <br>
</p>
<p>
  I noticed that a critical part that the original Mobile App Support missed was an Overview and a table of contents. This made it the readers
  to be able to know if they have ended up in the correct location. If the reader followed a link and did get to this point via following the
  US Bank website structure, it would likely be confusing without an overview. The table of contents allows a reader to click and jump directly
  to the content they need on the page, rather than going section-by-section searching for what they were actually looking for. 
</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/media/Blog-How-To_Files/Content-Focused.png" alt="A focused look at one of the parts of the mobile app Getting Started Guide 'Basic Transactions'. It includes hyperlinks to various related products and documentation"> <br>
</p>
<p>
  For the final primary part of my redesign, I created, from nearly nothing, a guide on how to use the US Bank mobile app. This is because the
  original makes little effort to on-board users that are not already experienced with mobile devices and apps. This guide goes through all the features
  and abilities of the app that a new user would be most interested in. Each section has a step-by-step guide that carefully leads new users through the process
  of using the features that might otherwise be neglected.
  <br>
  The guides start with an overview that conveys what this section is about. For a reader, they can determine themselves if this content is important for them
  as the follow move through each section. Skipping a section -- other than initial setup wherein app installation is explained -- does not make any future section
  more difficult as they were written with jumping around in mind. 
  <br>
  In addition, the guides are not hidden within drop down menus, making them easy to scan through and find what was being looked for. Screen readers
  will be capble of reading these easily now, and Control+F searches now can immediately find content a user is looking for or tell them it is not hear
  without the hassle of opening the menus.
